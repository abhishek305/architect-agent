  "context": "Building a video hosting and streaming platform similar to YouTube. Core features: video upload/transcoding, adaptive streaming (HLS/DASH), user channels, subscriptions, comments, likes, playlists, recommendations, live streaming, and creator monetization. Target: 100K concurrent viewers, 4K video support, global CDN distribution.\n\n**CRITICAL TECH STACK (DO NOT SUBSTITUTE):**\n- Frontend: React 19 SPA (NOT Next.js), TypeScript, Redux Toolkit for state management, Vanilla CSS with component-scoped Styled Components, mobile-first responsive design\n- Backend: NestJS with gRPC for internal microservice communication, REST for public API\n- Cloud: Google Cloud Platform (GKE, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage, Cloud CDN, Pub/Sub, Cloud Run)\n- Video: FFmpeg for transcoding, HLS/DASH adaptive streaming",

    "problem": "Creators need a platform with better revenue sharing than YouTube (70/30 vs 55/45), lower barriers to monetization, and more transparent algorithms. Viewers want ad-free options and better content discovery.",
    "targetUser": "Content creators (YouTubers, educators, streamers) seeking better monetization. Viewers aged 18-45 wanting premium ad-free experience. Enterprises needing private video hosting.",
    "successMetrics": "50K creators in year 1, 1M monthly active viewers, 99.95% video uptime, <3s time-to-first-frame, 4K streaming with <1% buffering, creator payout within 30 days.",
    "mvpScope": "Phase 1 (MVP): Video upload, transcoding, playback, user auth, channels, basic search. Phase 2: Subscriptions, comments, likes, playlists, recommendations. Phase 3: Live streaming, monetization, creator studio analytics.",
    "businessContext": "Series A funded, $2M runway. Team: 4 Backend (NestJS), 3 Frontend (React), 2 DevOps, 1 ML Engineer. Timeline: MVP in 16 weeks. Revenue: Premium subscriptions + creator revenue share.",
    "architecture": "Microservices architecture. Frontend: React 19 SPA with Vite. Backend: NestJS microservices communicating via gRPC. API Gateway: Kong. Database: Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) for metadata, Firestore for real-time. Storage: Cloud Storage for videos. CDN: Cloud CDN + Cloudflare. Queue: Pub/Sub for transcoding jobs. Search: Elasticsearch.",
    "security": "OAuth 2.0 (Google, Apple, Email). JWT with refresh tokens. Content encryption at rest. DRM for premium content. Rate limiting. DMCA takedown workflow. Age verification for restricted content.",
    "scale": "Start: 3-node GKE cluster. Scale: Horizontal pod autoscaling, Cloud SQL read replicas, multi-region storage. Video: Chunked upload, parallel transcoding workers, adaptive bitrate streaming. Target: 100K concurrent viewers, 10PB storage.",
    "stateManagement": "Redux Toolkit with RTK Query. Slices: auth, player, videos, channels, subscriptions, comments, playlists, recommendations. Persist watch history to localStorage. Real-time updates via WebSocket.",
    "styling": "Component-scoped Styled Components for React components. Vanilla CSS with CSS custom properties for global design tokens (colors, spacing, typography). Mobile-first breakpoints: 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px. Dark mode default.",
    "renderingStrategy": "React 19 SPA with client-side rendering. Vite for bundling. Code splitting by route. Lazy load video player. Intersection Observer for infinite scroll. Service Worker for offline support.",
    "performanceTargets": "LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1. Time-to-first-frame < 3s. Adaptive bitrate: 360p to 4K. Preload next video in queue. Virtual scrolling for comments.",
    "accessibility": "WCAG 2.1 AA. Keyboard navigation for player controls. Screen reader support. Captions/subtitles. Audio descriptions. High contrast mode. Reduced motion preference.",
    "testing": "Jest + React Testing Library for components. NestJS testing module for backend. Playwright for E2E. k6 for load testing. Target: 80% coverage, <5s E2E test per scenario.",
    "definitionOfDone": "- Code reviewed and merged\n- Unit tests (>80% coverage)\n- E2E tests passing\n- No lint errors (ESLint/Prettier)\n- Lighthouse score > 85\n- Mobile responsive verified\n- Accessibility audit passed\n- Deployed to staging\n- QA sign-off"
